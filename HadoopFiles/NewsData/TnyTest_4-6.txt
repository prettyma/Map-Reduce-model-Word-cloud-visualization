(Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday upheld a Massachusetts law banning assault weapons including the AR-15, saying the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment guarantee of Americans' right to bear firearms does not cover them.U.S. District Judge William Young in Boston ruled that assault weapons and large capacity magazines covered by the 1998 law were most useful in military service and fall outside the scope of the Second Amendment's personal right to bear arms."In the absence of federal legislation, Massachusetts is free to ban these weapons and large capacity magazines," Young wrote.He also rejected a challenge to an enforcement notice  Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey issued in 2016 to gun manufacturers and dealers clarifying what under the law is a "copy" of an assault weapon like the Colt AR-15.AdvertisementHealey announced that notice after a gunman killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida.AdvertisementHealey welcomed Young's ruling. "Strong gun laws save lives, and we will not be intimidated by the gun lobby in our efforts to end the sale of assault weapons and protect our communities and schools," she said in a statement.The decision came amid renewed attention to gun violence and firearms ownership after a gunman killed 17 students and staff  at a Florida high school in February, prompting a surge of gun control activism by teenage students.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

"This is because the words of our Constitution are not mutable. They mean the same today as they did 227 years ago when the Second Amendment was adopted."The Gun Owners' Action League of Massachusetts, which was among the plaintiffs who sued in 2017, said in a statement that it was concerned by the ruling, which sets a "dangerous precedent." It said it would consider its next steps.The U.S. Supreme Court in 2008 held for the first time that the Second Amendment guaranteed an individual's right to bear arms, but the ruling applied only to firearms kept in the home for self-defense.The justices have avoided taking another major gun case for eight years. Most recently, in November, the court refused to hear a case challenging Maryland's 2013 state ban on assault weapons.(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by James Dalgleish, Toni Reinhold)We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

Good Friday. Here’s what we’re watching:• Investors should get ready to feel “a little pain.”• Is the inflation scare over?• Hiring slowed in March.• The U.S.-China trade fight is getting hotter.• The Treasury Department sanctioned Russian mogul Oleg Deripaska.Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here.President Trump has supported combative trade policies for years, and in recent months, his administration has begun to pursue them. The actions have weighed on the stock prices of large international corporations, and if implemented, could hurt their bottom lines.But global companies mostly have not detailed the potential impact of Mr. Trump’s trade policies. Will that now change? With first-quarter earnings imminent, and tensions with China escalating, shareholders may want companies to make specific disclosures. The companies may be tempted to say little. After all, Mr. Trump’s trade restrictions have merely been threatened, and may not occur if deals are struck. But in the past, companies have refreshed their outlooks in the face of circumstantial economic and geopolitical events, like the Gulf War. And investors will likely press firms to estimate the impact of a trade war and describe the measures they will take to protect their businesses.AdvertisementBoeing, Apple and General Motors are among the companies that will come under the spotlight. All do considerable sales in China. Apple and G.M. rely on manufacturing facilities in the country. Investors will have plenty of questions. How much might revenue and profits fall in a trade war? What would you do if your supply chains got interrupted? What sort of contingency measures are you readying? What would you do if you became the target of campaigns that aimed to stop Chinese consumers buying your products, like the one last year directed at South Korean products?AdvertisementExecutives will no doubt have good arguments for why their businesses won’t be hurt much. China’s airlines will remain reliant on a steady supply of Boeing’s aircraft for a long time. The facilities in China that make G.M. and Apple products are big employers. And since the proposed tariffs most likely won’t be in effect by the time first-quarter earnings are announced, companies will probably be able to get away with some generalities.Still, the prospect of a trade war raises questions about the adequacy of corporate disclosure. Those of G.M., contained in its latest annual report, seem quite detailed. They offer quite specific warnings about the risks of doing business in China, and the company even mentions the possibility of trade agreements falling apart. But financial reports from Boeing and Apple arguably have less on potential problems in China and trade disputes.Boeing’s annual report did mention tariffs and embargoes as threats. But the report, released in February, also sounded a bullish note on the global economy that now almost sounds like it was from a different era:“The long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries.”Will such language remain in Boeing’s reports?- Peter EavisFor years, investors had a singular focus on the Federal Reserve and its plans to raise rates.Any indication that the Fed could move more aggressively than expected to tighten monetary policies and stocks would pull back.Now the Fed has company in sending jitters through the market: Trade.A one-two punch from the White House and the Fed pushed stocks on Wall Street down Friday. The S.&P. 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both finished off more than 2 percent.Markets began to slide at the start of trading after President Trump’s threat on Thursday to heap fresh tariffs on China. Investors took little comfort in statements from the administration’s top economic policymakers, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. Both men sought to tamp down the contentious back-and-forth between the two economic giants.Comments from Mr. Powell in the early Friday afternoon added to the unease. In a speech in Chicago, Mr. Powell highlighted the strength of the United States economic recovery and gave little indication that the Fed planned to deviate from its gradual path of lifting interest rates.President Trump, in a radio interview that was taped on Thursday and aired on Friday, acknowledged his approach to China could cause “a little pain” to financial markets but that it would be worth it in the long run.AdvertisementOn WABC Radio’s “Bernie & Sid in the Morning” show, Mr. Trump said:“Now we could—the easiest thing for me to do would be just to close my eyes and forget it.”“If I did that, I’m not doing my job. So, I’m not saying there won’t be a little pain but the market’s gone up 40 percent, 42 percent — so we might lose a little bit of it— but we’re going to have a much stronger country when we’re finished. And that’s what I’m all about. We have to do things that other people wouldn’t do.”The president also took to Twitter to defend his approach to trade policy. Mr. Trump, in a tweet, criticized both China and the World Trade Organization, saying that the Chinese “get tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to U.S.”
            China, which is a great economic power, is considered a Developing Nation within the World Trade Organization. They therefore get tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to U.S.        That followed another early morning tweet, in which Mr. Trump boasted that the new metals tariffs he has put into effect on China and other nations had not hurt American consumers as his critics predicted.
            Despite the Aluminum Tariffs, Aluminum prices are DOWN 4%. People are surprised, I’m not! Lots of money coming into U.S. coffers and Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!        Some context here: The price of aluminum per pound has been falling since February, a decline that started before the tariffs were imposed. Mr. Trump’s decision to exempt Canada, which supplied more than half of America’s aluminum imports in 2016, has also helped to soften the blow from tariffs, companies say.In response to a potential new set of U.S. tariffs on $100 billion worth of Chinese goods, Beijing said in a briefing on Friday that it would “immediately fight back with a major response.”More from what a representative for China’s Ministry of Commerce said:“We feel America is very arrogant. They have taken a wrong action. The result is that they will hurt themselves.”The briefing — amid a Chinese holiday — signals the latest instance of saber-rattling between the U.S. and China on trade. But was Mr. Trump’s announcement on Thursday just a bluff? Even his advisers aren’t sure.The Chinese official said that the two sides can’t negotiate under the current conditions. And in an interview with Bloomberg on Friday, Larry Kudlow — who has been national economic adviser for just under a week — said he could not predict when talks would begin. He added:
            Kudlow on China tariffs in a Bloomberg intvu just now: "This is a moderate, temperate approach that we are taking."        But China has reasons to think it could win a trade war. (Worth noting: U.S. tariffs wouldn’t bite until after a two-month comment period.)More companies, like Cargill, are getting jumpy. Some fear the tensions could kill Qualcomm’s bid for NXP Semiconductor. Jacob Frenkel, the chairman of JPMorgan Chase’s international business, is worried, too: He said the hostilities could be “the greatest danger to the world economy,” but aren’t at a war level yet. The Economist says that the president’s comments “do not suggest he is ready to sue for peace.”AdvertisementMeanwhile, the White House hopes to announce a preliminary Nafta deal this month after revising some of its more aggressive demands.Reaction of the day, from Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska:
            Hopefully the President is just blowing off steam, but setting Amer agriculture on fire is not a plan. My statement: pic.twitter.com/zSJhYZPDK2 Earlier this year, stocks sold off after the jobs report for January showed a 2.9 percent annual increase in wages, a relatively strong rise. Investors feared that a sustained increase in earnings could prompt consumers to buy more goods and services, pushing up prices in the process. Concerns receded after February’s report showed a 2.6 percent jump in wages, and March’s rise of 2.7 percent is not likely to stir up more worries.But as they gauge wage pressures, analysts also pay close attention to the forces that indirectly affect wages. One of those is, of course, the number of additional jobs the economy is creating. March’s gain of 103,000 jobs was below economists’ forecasts and about half the monthly average this year. That weakness will no doubt reduce inflation fears still further.The March report contained data that could do even more to quell investors’ nerves over inflation. While the report revised February’s gain higher to 326,000 jobs from 313,000, it sharply reduced the January figure to 176,000 from 239,000. The January revision prompted Jim Vogel, of FTN Financial, to write:“That collapsed what had been an upward slope to the last two years of payroll growth and implicitly reduced the upward pressure on wages that so many are still certain will arrive this year.”— Peter EavisThe United States added jobs for its 90th straight month in March, an unprecedented run of growth for the economy, but at a much slower pace than in March.The headline numbers APRIL 6, 2018
• 103,000 jobs were added last month. Wall Street economists had expected an increase of about 185,000, according to Bloomberg.• The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent for the sixth straight month.APRIL 6, 2018
• Average earnings rose by 8 cents an hour and are up 2.7 percent over the past year.APRIL 6, 2018
• Estimates of February’s job growth were revised upward, but January’s figure was revised sharply downward. The net result was a loss of 50,000 jobs relative to prior estimates.The takeaways• Wage growth remains weaker than most economists would expect when unemployment is so low.Advertisement• The manufacturing sector has posted solid job gains over the past year, and that growth continued in March, when American factories added 22,000 jobs. But mounting trade tensions with China could threaten the sector’s rebound in the months ahead.• Perhaps the biggest surprise in the blockbuster February report was the surge of workers into the labor force. That flood of new workers partly reversed in March, when the labor force shrank by 158,000 people.There’s a lot to quote from Anthony Scaramucci’s meal with Edward Luce of the FT — held at the Hunt and Fish Club, the Midtown Manhattan restaurant that the onetime investor owns, naturally. So we’ll have to limit ourselves to just a few selections:• “That’s something I get no credit for, by the way,” he says. “I have been for equal opportunity in gay marriage for the last 12 or 13 years.”• “See this?” he says. “These are front-stabbing knives. You only use these in New York. In Washington you use a shiv, or mechanisms in the press, back-stabbing, subterfuge, opposition research . . . Not in New York. We come at you right from the front.”• “My parents thought it was Hartford law school, Connecticut — not Harvard,” he says. “True story. They’re still alive — you can ask them. When I told them I was going to Goldman Sachs they didn’t know what that was, either.• “Wall Street is a circulatory system for American capitalism. If its arterial flow is blocked, it blunts and slows down the economic engine for everyone else.”— Michael de la MercedProminent among the Russian oligarchs and businesses sanctioned by the Treasury Department on Friday is Oleg Deripaska, the billionaire known for his jet-setting, his consistent presence at the World Economic Forum in Davos — and his ties to Vladimir Putin (and, before a falling out, Paul Manafort).Mr. Deripaska is associated with aluminum producers like EN+ Group, which went public in London late year, and Rusal, as well as the commercial vehicle maker GAZ Group and energy producer EuroSibEnergo. All those companies were also sanctioned for being controlled or owned directly or indirectly by Mr. Deripaska.Here’s what the Treasury Department said about the move against the businessman:Oleg Deripaska is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13661 for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, a senior official of the Government of the Russian Federation, as well as pursuant to E.O. 13662 for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Deripaska has said that he does not separate himself from the Russian state. He has also acknowledged possessing a Russian diplomatic passport, and claims to have represented the Russian government in other countries. Deripaska has been investigated for money laundering, and has been accused of threatening the lives of business rivals, illegally wiretapping a government official, and taking part in extortion and racketeering. There are also allegations that Deripaska bribed a government official, ordered the murder of a businessman, and had links to a Russian organized crime group.— Michael de la MercedAndrew’s take: A favorite Wall Street parlor game is whether the JPMorgan Chase C.E.O. would run for president in 2020. Mr. Dimon’s latest annual letter increased that chatter, touching on immigration and political polarization. He praised some of President Trump’s policies (on tougher trade negotiations, on taxes). But his stances on deregulation and on social issues likely mean that he would have to run as an independent — and history hasn’t been kind to third-party candidates.Peter Eavis adds: The JPMorgan chief also homed in on regulations of bank liquidity, or access to cash and equivalents. He contended that liquidity requirements are higher now — which he favors — but are also more rigid and could impinge on lending. But the argument is flawed, in part because banks that have less liquidity aren’t in a position to lend.The investment behemoth’s plan to offer new funds that exclude gun makers or sellers is the latest prominent step by a financial firm to offer some support to gun control. (And with $6.3 trillion under management, the firm’s actions carry enormous weight.) The products include:• A new exchange-traded fund that focuses on favorable environmental, social and governance (E.S.G.) standards and excludes firearms-related companies. BlackRock will update other E.S.G. funds to exclude them, too.Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
