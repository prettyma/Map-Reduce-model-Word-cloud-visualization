@CNN Washington’s “sanctions” never seem to work! Even North Korea has found ways to get around them! Russia has hacked our Elections &amp; our Grids, amongst other things! These are acts of War. Sanctions are a joke!

"Basically at this moment, it wouldn't surprise me if China, Russia and North Korea teamed up against the US, whom drag the allies with them, and creating World War Three in the process. 
Why has the USA been so hostile of late anyway?"
"So any one else seeing world war three coming?
From the weapon carting by North Korea, the arguments with Russia and the tariffs against China. Three countries all having history of War. Wouldn't put it past China and North Korea teaming up if this ridiculousness continues."
Former South Korean President Park Geun-hye was found guilty of corruption. By whom? By an even more corrupted oligarchic androcracy who turned an otherwise very successful politician into a scapegoat. With her in power, none of the silliness with North Korea would have happened.
can’t wait for the @TIME follow-up report on the upcoming ‘high-stakes summits’ of North Korea with Trump and Xi. what will happen next lies on the negotiations, and hopefully neither of them is empty-handed

#Skripal obviously dropping down the news agenda...don’t look at Brexit don’t look at Brexit don’t look at Brexit.. North Korea soon likely to have missiles that could reach UK – MPs https://t.co/XKIlA21yCa
If North Korea can fire a missile which can reach Britain in 18 months (according to the headlines), wouldn't that give us rather a lot of time to attempt to intercept it?
“.. North Korea will almost certainly be able to reach #UK shores with an intercontinental ballistic missile within six to 18 months, MPs have said”. Now that is one slow moving missile. We could send up some Spitfires to intercept them.
